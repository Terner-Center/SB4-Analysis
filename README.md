# The Housing Potential of Faith Based and Non-Profit College Lands

This repo contains the csv file with the analysis for all California counties presented in the 2023 paper **The Housing Potential of Faith Based and Non-Profit College Lands**

In Table_1A_Church_Totals.csv, the figures with a * are interpolated estimates based on the county population. We calculated the average ratio of a given feature value to population (e.g., total parcels owned by an institute of higher learning per capita) for all counties adjoining each of these nine counties. Then, we multiplied that ratio by the population of the county for which we wanted to interpolate data. Also in this table, the figure listed for a state total under the Median Parcel Size column. Note that because our methodology excludes parcels under 10,000 square feet this figure will be higher than it would be otherwise.
